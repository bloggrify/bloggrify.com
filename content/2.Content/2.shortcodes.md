description: "One of Bloggrify's most powerful features is the ability to use Vue components directly in your Markdown files."

It uses the [Nuxt Content module](https://content.nuxt.com/docs/files/markdown#vue-components) under the hood to parse Markdown files and render Vue components. This allows you to create custom components and use them in your content.

Here is a list of some of the built-in components you can use in your Markdown files:

* Alerts
* Code blocks
* YouTube videos
* Twitter tweets
* Instagram posts
* Vimeo videos
* Instagram posts

### Using Custom Components

You can create your own [custom components](https://content.nuxt.com/usage/markdown#vue-components) to extend Markdown functionality:

1. Create a Vue component in your `components/content` directory
2. Use it directly in your Markdown content
3. Pass props and content as needed

```markdown
::custom-alert{type="warning"}
This is a custom alert
::
```
