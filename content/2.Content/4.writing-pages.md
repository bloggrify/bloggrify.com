# Writing Pages

Bloggrify is made to let you write all your content in Markdown and Vue components with the MDC syntax.

Each Markdown pages in the `content/` folder will be mapped to a route.

| File                   | Generated route       |
|------------------------|:----------------------|
| `index.md`             | `/`                   |
| `about.md`             | `/about`              |
| `2024-02-24/post01.md` | `/2024-02-02/post01`  |
| `2024/02/24/post01.md` | `/2024/02/02/post01`  |

::alert
It is highly recommended to use a hierarchical structure for the files, to make the blog more organized and to make the urls more meaningful.
