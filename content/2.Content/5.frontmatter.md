All the files are markdown files with a frontmatter at the top of the file. They are all listed on the index page, except the ones
* with the `draft: true` property.
* with the `listed: false` property.

Bloggrify supports multiple Front-matter attributes for pages.

It also supports frontmatter to add metadata to your markdown files.
