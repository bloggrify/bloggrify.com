# Comment system

You can enable comments on your blog. It uses [Hyvor Talk](https://talk.hyvor.com/).

If you want to use it, **you'll need to create an account** and get a website id.

Then, you can enable it by adding the following code to the `nuxt.config.ts` file:

```typescript
            comments: {
                enabled: true,
                hyvor_talk: {
                    website_id: "YOUR_HYVOR_TALK_WEBSITE_ID",
                },
            },
```

::alert
Replace `YOUR_HYVOR_TALK_WEBSITE_ID` with your Hyvor Talk website id.
