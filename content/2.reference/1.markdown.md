# Markdown

For a live demo, you can look at our [own blog](https://mistral.bloggrify.com).

## Standard markdown features
You can use all standard markdown features such as:
* text formatting
* images
* links 
* code blocks (with copy paste button, syntax highlighting, etc.)
* etc.

But you can also use more advanced features such as :
* tables
* footnotes
* mathematics
* charts (flowcharts, class diagram etc.)


## Custom components
You can also use [custom components](https://content.nuxt.com/usage/markdown#vue-components) with vue.js to extend markdown features.
