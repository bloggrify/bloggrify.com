# Markdown

## Standard markdown features
You can use all standard markdown features such as:
text formatting, images, links, code blocks, etc.

You should read the [official markdown documentation](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more about markdown.   
Edit this file to see how it works.

## Horizontal Rules

___

---

***


## Emphasis

**This is bold text**

__This is bold text__

*This is italic text*

_This is italic text_

~~Strikethrough~~

## Blockquotes


> Blockquotes can also be nested...
>> ...by using additional greater-than signs right next to each other...
> > > ...or with spaces between arrows.


## Lists

Unordered

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
    - Marker character change forces new list start:
        * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
        + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
        - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa


1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar


## Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code


Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

Nuxt-content provide code highlighting with [shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki). You can specify the language of the code block to enable syntax highlighting:
This is a paragraph with a code block:
``` js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```

## Custom components
