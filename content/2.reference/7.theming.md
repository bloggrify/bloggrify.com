# Theming 

It is possible to change the look and feel of your blog by changing the theme. By default, Bloggrify comes with the "Mistral" theme, but you can create your own theme or use a theme created by the community. You can find some templates [here](https://bloggr.eventuallycoding.com/#templates).

The theming system use extensively the [concept of layers in Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/docs/examples/advanced/config-extends) and [layouts](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/layouts). A theme `extends` [Bloggrify](https://github.com/hlassiege/bloggrify) and brings its own configuration and components. 

## Structure of a theme

A theme is a Nuxt module. It is a folder that contains :
- an `app.config.ts` file. The `app.config.ts` file contains the configuration of the theme. 
- a `components/themes/MYTHEME` folder. The `components` folder contains the components of the theme.
- a `layouts/themes/MYTHEME` folder. The `layout` that can be used into each page. 
- a `content` folder. It is where you write your articles.
- a `assets` folder (OPTIONAL). It is where you put your images and other assets (css files, etc.)
- a `public` folder (OPTIONAL). It is where you put your static files (like a favicon etc.)

Each theme **should** have the following components (with the exact same name):

- `layouts/themes/MYTHEME/default.vue`: The default layout for all pages. Of course you can create other layouts if you want for specific pages (like the home page)

And then you can select the theme in the `app.config.ts` file.

```typescript
export default defineAppConfig({
    theme: "MYTHEME",
    // ...
})
```

## Create a new theme

To create a new theme, you can start with the ["Mistral"](https://github.com/hlassiege/bloggrify-mistral) theme. It is a simple and clean template. You can clone the repository and start modifying it.

This is a nuxt-application so you can benefit from all the features of Nuxt. You can use the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxt.com/) to help you. But most of the time, you'll only need to modify the files in the `components` folder and the `app.config.ts` file.
