# Search

Bloggrify comes with a search feature that allows you to search through all your content. It uses the Nuxt-content and Nuxt-UI integration to provide a fast and efficient search.

The content is indexed at build time, so the search is fast and doesn't require any server-side processing nor any external service.

## How to use it

The search is available on the top right corner of the blog. You can click on the search icon to open the search bar **IF** the theme you are using has the search bar enabled.
