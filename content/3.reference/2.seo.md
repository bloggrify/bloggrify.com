# SEO considerations

Bloggrify is SEO friendly.

By default the language of the blog is set to "en" in the `app.config.ts` file. You can change it to your language.

```typescript
export default defineAppConfig({
  ...
  language: 'en'
  ...
})
```

## Open Graph and Twitter cards

This blog uses the [useHead](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-head) composables to add metadata to the head of the pages.

All pages have a default title and description.
You can tweak the image, title and description of each page in the frontmatter of the markdown file.

This is highly recommended to do so to have a good SEO, not even mentioning that your blog will look broken if you don't define title for each page...

## Performance

Performance are an important part of SEO. Here is the lighthouse score of this blog:

| index page                                | blog post                                          |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| ![index page](/images/doc/lighthouse.jpg) | ![blog post](/images/doc/lighthouse-blog-post.jpg) |

Performance could vary depending on the server and the network and images you use in your blog.

## Schema.org

Bloggrify uses the [schema.org](https://schema.org/) vocabulary to add structured data to the blog and use the [Nuxt SEO module](https://nuxtseo.com/docs/schema-org) to generate the metadata.

Everything is done automatically, you don't have to do anything.
