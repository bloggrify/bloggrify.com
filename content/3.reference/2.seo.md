# SEO considerations

Bloggrify is SEO friendly.

By default the language of the blog is set to "en" in the `app.config.ts` file. You can change it to your language.

```typescript
export default defineAppConfig({
  ...
  language: 'en'
  ...
})
```

## Open Graph and Twitter cards

Bloggrify uses the [useHead](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-head) composable to add metadata to the head of the pages.

All pages have a default title and description.
You can customize the image, title and description of each page in the frontmatter of the markdown file.

### Auto-generated OG Images

Bloggrify automatically generates Open Graph images for your blog posts when no custom cover image is specified.

**How it works:**

1. **With a custom cover** (recommended for important posts):
```yaml
---
title: My Blog Post
cover: my-custom-image.png
---
```

2. **Without a cover** (auto-generation):
```yaml
---
title: My Blog Post
description: A short description
---
```

When no `cover` is specified, Bloggrify generates an OG image with:
- Your post title
- Description (if provided)

**Why this matters:**
- Better social media sharing (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook)
- Professional appearance without manual image creation
- Consistent branding across all posts

## Performance

Performance are an important part of SEO. Here is the lighthouse score of this blog:

| index page                                | blog post                                          |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| ![index page](/images/doc/lighthouse.jpg) | ![blog post](/images/doc/lighthouse-blog-post.jpg) |

Performance could vary depending on the server and the network and images you use in your blog.

## Schema.org

Bloggrify uses the [schema.org](https://schema.org/) vocabulary to add structured data to the blog and use the [Nuxt SEO module](https://nuxtseo.com/docs/schema-org) to generate the metadata.

Everything is done automatically, you don't have to do anything.
