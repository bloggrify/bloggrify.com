By default, indexation is disabled. To enable it, you need to set the `SITE_INDEXABLE` option to `true` in the `.env` file or in your environment variables.

```env 
SITE_INDEXABLE=true
```

Then, the robots.txt allows all robots to crawl the website. This can be modified in the `nuxt.config.ts` file.

Bloggrify uses the `@nuxtjs/robots` module to generate the robots.txt file. 

You can read more about the module [@nuxtjs/robots on their official documentation](https://nuxtseo.com/docs/robots/getting-started/introduction).

Let's say you want to block all robots from crawling your website. You can do this by adding the following configuration in the `nuxt.config.ts` file:

```typescript
robots: { 
    UserAgent: '*',
    Disallow: '/'
}
```

If you want to disallow Yandex from crawling your website, you can do this by adding the following configuration in the `nuxt.config.ts` file:

```typescript
robots: { 
    UserAgent: 'Yandex',
    Disallow: '/'
}
```

## Before version 2.0.0

By default, the robots.txt allows all robots to crawl the website. It's possible to modify the robots.txt file in the `app.config.ts` file.

For example if you don't want to block yandex:
```typescript
    robots: [
    {
        UserAgent: "Yandex",
        Disallow: ["/"],
    },
],
```

The default configuration allows all robots to crawl the website.

::alert
Don't forget to configure URL with the url of your website at the top of the app.config.ts file.
