# Installation

## First method, start from a theme

To start a new blog with Bloggrify, **you have to choose a theme** to start with.

You can start with "Mistral", the default template. It is a simple and clean template but you can also look at the [other templates available](/templates).

Once you have chosen a template, you can start a new project with the following command:

1. Clone the theme repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bloggrify/demo-mistral.git bloggrify
```

2. Install the dependencies from the root of the project.

::code-group

  ```bash [npm]
  npm install
  ```

  ```bash [yarn]
  yarn install
  ```

  ```bash [pnpm]
  pnpm install --shamefully-hoist
  ```

::

3. Run the `dev` command to start Bloggrify in development mode:

::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm run dev
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn dev
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm run dev
```

## Second method, start from scratch

Let's start a new project from scratch.

1. Create a new project with the following command:

```bash
npx create-nuxt-app bloggrify
```

2. Add the required dependencies:

```json
    "dependencies": {
        "@bloggrify/core": "latest",
        "nuxt": "3.11.2"
    },
```

3. Edit the `nuxt.config.ts` file to extend the Bloggrify core engine:

```typescript
    extends: [
        '@bloggrify/core',
    ],
```

4. Create your own theme

Follow the [theme creation guide](/reference/theming) to create your own theme.
