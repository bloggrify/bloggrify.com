# Installation

## Easy installation

First, you need to create a new Nuxt application. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npx nuxi@latest init myblog
```

Then, you need to install the dependencies:

```bash
cd myblog # the blog you just created
npm install @bloggrify/core
npm install -D sass-embedded
```

Then you have to explicitly say to Nuxt that you are using Bloggrify as an extended module. You can do this by adding the following line in your `nuxt.config.js` file:

```json
    extends: [
        '@bloggrify/core',
    ],
```

## Create a basic configuration file

You should create a default configuration file in the root of your project: `app.config.ts`. 

The first configuration you should add is the `theme` of your website. 

```typescript
export default defineAppConfig({
    theme: 'minimalist',
})
```

It's enough to test locally, but you should read more about the configuration options [here](/introduction/configuration).

✨ You can start with the "Minimalist" theme. You can also [change the theme later](/recipes/change-theme) or [create your own theme](/recipes/theme-recipe).

## Create your first content

By default, there is no content in your project.

Start by creating a new folder called `content` in the root of your project. This folder will contain all the content of your website.

Create your index page by creating a new file called `index.md` in the `content` folder.

```markdown
---
title: Welcome to Bloggrify
description: A simple blog with Bloggrify
layout: home
listed: false
---
```

Later, you'll add more [content](/content/writing-pages).

## Remove the default app.vue

You should remove the default `app.vue` file provided by Nuxt init.

```bash
rm app.vue
```

## Test your blog

You can run the development server on http://localhost:3000 and start with the default template.

::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm run dev
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn dev
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm run dev
```

✨ Well done! A browser window should automatically open for <http://localhost:3000>
