# Installation

## First method, start from a theme

To start a new blog with Bloggrify, **you have to choose a theme** to start with.

You can start with "Mistral", the default template. It is a simple and clean template but you can also look at the [other templates available](https://bloggrify.com/#templates).

Once you have chosen a template, you can start a new project with the following command:

1. Clone the theme repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hlassiege/demo-mistral.git bloggrify
```

2. Install the dependencies from the root of the project.

::code-group

  ```bash [npm]
  npm install
  ```

  ```bash [yarn]
  yarn install
  ```

  ```bash [pnpm]
  pnpm install --shamefully-hoist
  ```

::

3. Run the `dev` command to start Bloggrify in development mode:

::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm run dev
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn dev
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm run dev
```

âœ¨ Well done! A browser window should automatically open for <http://localhost:3000>

## Second method, start from scratch

TODO I'll write this section. In the meantime, you should start from the mistral template (or another one) and then customize it to your needs.
