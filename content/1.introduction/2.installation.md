# Installation

## Create a new project

To start a new blog with Bloggr, you have to choose a template to start with.

You can start with "Mistral", the default template. It is a simple and clean template but you can also look at the [other templates available](https://bloggr.eventuallycoding.com/#templates).

Once you have chosen a template, you can start a new project with the following command:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hlassiege/bloggr-mistral.git bloggr
```

2. Install the dependencies from the root of the project.

::code-group

  ```bash [npm]
  npm install
  ```

  ```bash [yarn]
  yarn install
  ```

  ```bash [pnpm]
  pnpm install --shamefully-hoist
  ```

::

3. Run the `dev` command to start Bloggr in development mode:

::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm run dev
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn dev
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm run dev
```
