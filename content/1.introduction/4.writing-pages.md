# Writing Pages

Bloggr is made to let you write all your content in Markdown and Vue components with the MDC syntax.

Each Markdown pages in the `content/` folder will be mapped to a route.

| File                   | Generated route       |
|------------------------|:----------------------|
| `index.md`             | `/`                   |
| `about.md`             | `/about`              |
| `2024-02-24/post01.md` | `/2024-02-02/post01`  |
| `2024/02/24/post01.md` | `/2024/02/02/post01`  |

::alert
It is highly recommended to use a hierarchical structure for the files, to make the blog more organized and to make the urls more meaningful.

## Frontmatter

All the files are markdown files with a frontmatter at the top of the file. They are all listed on the index page, except the ones
* with the `draft: true` property.
* with the `listed: false` property.


Docus supports multiple Front-matter attributes for pages.

It also supports frontmatter to add metadata to your markdown files.

```yaml
---
id: "2"
title: "Use markdown power"
description: "Use markdown at its full potential."
date: "2024-02-09"
tags:
  - markdown
cover: "doc/markdown.png"
---
```

Here is the list of all the frontmatter attributes:
