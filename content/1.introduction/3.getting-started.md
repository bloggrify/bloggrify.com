Once your blog is deployed, you can start writing your content.

## Creating Your First Post

You have two options to create a new blog post:

### Option 1: Using the CLI (Recommended)

The easiest way to create a new post is using the Bloggrify CLI:

```bash
npx bloggrify new post "My first blog post"
```

This will create a properly structured markdown file with all required frontmatter in `content/YYYY/MM/DD/my-first-blog-post.md`.

::alert{type="info"}

### Option 2: Manual Creation

Alternatively, create a file named `your-first-blog-post.md` manually in the `content/` directory.
You can use the following content as a starting point. 

```markdown
---
title: "My first blog post"
description: "This is my first blog post"
date: "2024-02-24"
categories:
  - blog
  - opensource
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
---
# My first blog post

This is my first blog post. I hope you will enjoy it.
```

And then you can appreciate the result on http://localhost:3000/your-first-blog-post
