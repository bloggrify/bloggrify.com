# Getting Started

Once your blog is deployed, you can start writing your content.

Just create your first markdown file in the `content/` directory and start writing.

Let's try.

Create a file named `your-first-blog-post.md` in the `content/` directory.
You can use the following content as a starting point. 

```markdown
---
title: "My first blog post"
description: "This is my first blog post"
date: "2024-02-24"
categories:
  - blog
  - opensource
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
---
# My first blog post

This is my first blog post. I hope you will enjoy it.
```

And then you can appreciate the result on http://localhost:3000/your-first-blog-post
