# Comparison of Bloggrify with other Blogging Platforms

## Why Choose Bloggrify?
Bloggrify stands out for its simplicity, speed, and security. Itâ€™s particularly user-friendly for those familiar with Markdown, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers.

## Comparison with server-based platforms 

Bloggrify is a static blog generator, which means that it generates all the pages at build time. This is a huge advantage for security and performance.

* It is **secure** because there is no server-side code that can be hacked.
* It is **fast** because there is no database to query and no server-side code to execute.
* It is **simple** because it is just a bunch of files.
* It is **cheap** because it can be hosted on a static hosting provider.
* It is **scalable** because it can be hosted on a CDN.
* It is **reliable** unless your hosting provider or CDN goes down. No database to corrupt, no server to crash.

### Comparison against WordPress
WordPress: Powerful but complex, with potential security vulnerabilities and slower performance due to its reliance on databases and server-side processing.

### Comparison against Ghost
Ghost: Focused on publishing and speed, but still requires server maintenance and can be costly.

## Comparison with other static blog generators

### Bloggrify vs Nuxt-content

Nuxt-content is an extremely good product and that's why Bloggrify is built on top of Nuxt-content !  
It means you can build exactly the same blog with Nuxt-content. Bloggrify is a wrapper around Nuxt-content to make it easier to use.

Of course, you can use Nuxt-content directly, but you'll have to write a lot of code to make it look like a blog. Bloggrify is here to help you with that.

### Bloggrify vs Gridsome

Gridsome is a great product. It is built on top of Vue.js and GraphQL, and it is very powerful.

However, it is more complex than Bloggrify and can be used to create documentation, blog, landing page, and many other things.
If you just want to create a blog, you don't need all this power, and you may find Bloggrify easier to use.


### Bloggrify vs Jekyll, Hugo, Pelican, Gatsby etc.

First of all, all those products are great.

The main difference is that Bloggrify is built on top of Nuxt-content, which is built on top of Nuxt.js. 
It means the templating system is Vue.js, and the content is written in Markdown.

If you want to tweak your own template, and if you are familiar with Vue.js, you will feel right at home. 
If you're not comfortable templating in go, liquid, twig, or React, you should consider Bloggrify.

Focus: 

* Jekyll: Popular and mature, but can be slower and more complex for those not familiar with Ruby.
* Hugo: Known for its speed and flexibility, but its Go-based templates can have a steep learning curve.


### Bloggrify vs Docsify, VuePress, Gitbook, VitePress, Slate, Docusaurus, MkDocs etc.

All these products are designed to help you create documentation, not a blog.

If your goal is to create a blog, you should consider Bloggrify.
