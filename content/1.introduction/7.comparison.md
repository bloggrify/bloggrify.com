# Comparison with other blogging platforms

Amongst all blogging platforms, you'll find two different families : the ones that needs a server to run, and the ones that are static.

## Comparison against server-based platforms (wordpress, ghost, etc.)

Bloggrify is a static blog generator, which means that it generates all the pages at build time. This is a huge advantage for security and performance.

* It is **secure** because there is no server-side code that can be hacked.
* It is **fast** because there is no database to query and no server-side code to execute.
* It is **simple** because it is just a bunch of files.
* It is **cheap** because it can be hosted on a static hosting provider.
* It is **scalable** because it can be hosted on a CDN.
* It is **reliable** unless your hosting provider or CDN goes down. No database to corrupt, no server to crash.

If you want more information about why you should use static site generators, you can read [this article](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/05/04/what-are-static-site-generators-and-why-should-you-use-them/).

## Comparison against other static blog generators

### Bloggrify vs Nuxt-content

Nuxt-content is an extremely good product and that's why Bloggrify is built on top of Nuxt-content !  
It means you can build exactly the same blog with Nuxt-content. Bloggrify is just a wrapper around Nuxt-content to make it easier to use.

Of course, you can use Nuxt-content directly, but you'll have to write a lot of code to make it look like a blog. Bloggrify is here to help you with that.

### Bloggrify vs Gridsome

Gridsome is a great product, I love it. It is built on top of Vue.js and GraphQL, and it is very powerful.

However, it is more complex than Bloggrify and can be used to create documentation, blog, landing page, and many other things.
If you just want to create a blog, you don't need all this power, and you may find Bloggrify easier to use.


### Bloggrify vs Jekyll, Hugo, Pelican, Gatsby etc.

First of all, all those products are great.

The main difference is that Bloggrify is built on top of Nuxt-content, which is built on top of Nuxt.js. 
It means the templating system is Vue.js, and the content is written in Markdown.

If you want to tweak your own template, and if you are familiar with Vue.js, you will feel right at home. 
If you're not comfortable templating in go, liquid, twig, or React, you should consider Bloggrify.

### Bloggrify vs Docsify, VuePress, Gitbook, VitePress, Slate, Docusaurus, MkDocs etc.

All these products are designed to help you create documentation, not a blog.

If your goal is to create a blog, you should consider Bloggrify.
