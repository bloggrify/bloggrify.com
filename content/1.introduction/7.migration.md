# Migration

## Migrating from v1.8 to v2.0

Version 2.0 of Bloggrify introduces a few breaking changes. This guide will help you migrate your existing project to the latest version.

There is two versions of this migration guide:
- one for general users
- one for theme developers

### For general users

#### Configuration

##### Base URL

The url of the website is now configured in the `.env` file. You have to define the `BASE_URL` variable in this file, or available in the environment variables.

It replaces the `url` property in the `app.config.ts` file.

##### Alternate links

The format of the alternate links in the frontmatter of the markdown file has changed. 

Before:
```yaml
---
language: "fr"
alternates:
  - en: "/2025/01/2024-review"
---
```

After:
```yaml
---
alternates:
  - hreflang: "en"
    href: "/2025/01/2024-review"
  - hreflang: "fr"
    href: "/fr//2025/01/2024-review"
---
```

### For theme developers

#### layouts

All layouts have been simplified and needs less props.

`default.vue` and `home.vue` layout:
```js
defineProps<{
    doc: unknown;
}>()
```

`archives.vue` layout don't need any props. You may use the `MinimalistListing` component to display the list of articles, or you can create your own component.

`tag.vue` layout:
```js
defineProps<{
    tag: string;
}>()
```
and `category.vue` layout:
```js
defineProps<{
    category: string;
}>()
```

Both can use the `MinimalistListing` component to display the list of articles.

Example of `tag.vue` layout:
```html
<template>
  <MinimalistListing format="list" :tag="tag"/>
</template>
```
