# Project Structure

Bloggr is built on top of Nuxt-content, if you are familiar with Nuxt, you will feel right at home.

## Directory Structure

All the files you need to edit are in the `content/` directory, plus the `app.config.ts` file.

```bash
content/
  index.md
```

The `content/` directory is where you [write Markdown pages](/introduction/writing-pages).

The `app.config.ts` is where you [configure Bloggr](/introduction/configuration) to fit your branding and design.
