# Deployment

## Manual deployment

To deploy your blog, you should first generate the static files with the following command:

```bash
npm run generate
```

Then, you can deploy the `dist` folder to your favorite hosting provider.


## Netlify deployment

If you have an account on Netlify, you can deploy in one click : 

[![Netlify deploy button](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/bloggrify/demo-mistral.git)

This will create a new repository on your github account and deploy the blog on Netlify.

Alternatively, especially if you want to deploy another template, you can deploy manually on Netlify by following these steps:

## Deploying on a subfolder

If you want to deploy your blog on a subfolder, like `https://bloggrify.com/subfolder`, you can set the `baseURL` property in the `nuxt.config.ts` file:

```typescript
export default defineNuxtConfig({
    app: {
        baseURL: '/subfolder/'
    }
})
```
Then you have to change the `url` in the `app.config.ts` file:

```typescript
export default defineAppConfig({

    url: 'https://bloggrify.com/subfolder',
})
```
