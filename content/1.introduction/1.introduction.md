# Introduction

From your Markdown files to a deployed blog in few minutes.

Bloggrify is built on top of
* [Nuxt.js 3.x](https://nuxt.com/)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [Nuxt-Content](https://content.nuxt.com/)
* and other cool stuff

Bloggrify is a **static** blog generator that uses markdown files to generate blog posts.
 
* It is **secure** because there is no server-side code that can be hacked.
* It is **fast** because there is no database to query and no server-side code to execute.
* It is **simple** because it is just a bunch of files.
* It is **cheap** because it can be hosted on a static hosting provider.
