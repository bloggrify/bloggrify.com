In this recipe, we will create a new [theme](/reference/theming) from scratch. We will (re)create the theme called "Minimalist" that is included in the Bloggrify core repository.

## Getting Started

First, you need to create a new Nuxt application. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npx nuxi@latest init neo-minimalist
```

Then, you need to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install @bloggrify/core
npm install -D sass-embedded
```

Then you have to explicitly say to Nuxt that you are using Bloggrify as an extended module. You can do this by adding the following line in your `nuxt.config.js` file:

```typescript
    extends: [
        '@bloggrify/core',
    ],
```

## Create a basic configuration file

Create a new file called `app.config.ts` in the root of your project. This file will contain the configuration of your theme.   
This file will override the default configuration of Bloggrify. If you don't specify a configuration, the default configuration will be used.

Here is an example of a basic configuration file:

```typescript
export default defineAppConfig({
    url: 'https://neo-minimalist.bloggrify.com/',

    theme: 'neo-minimalist',

    name: 'Neo-minimalist Demo',
    description:
        'A minimalist theme for Bloggrify',

})
```

That's probably not enough for a complete theme, but it's a good start. You can add more configuration options later. Don't forget to read the [official documentation](https://bloggrify.com/introduction/configuration) to know more about the configuration options.

## Create the layout for the home page 

Create a new folder called `layouts/themes/neo-minimalist` in the root of your project. This folder will contain the layouts of your theme.

Create a new file called `home.vue` in the `layouts/themes/neo-minimalist` folder. This file will be the layout for the home page.


Here is an example of a basic layout file:

```vue
<template>
    <div>
        <header>
            <h1>
                {{ title }}
            </h1>
        </header>

        <main>
            <div>
                <div >
                      {{ description }}
                </div>

              <div >
                <NuxtLink to="/archives">
                  Read all posts
                </NuxtLink>
              </div>
            </div>
        </main>
    </div>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">

defineProps<{
    doc: unknown;
}>()
const config = useAppConfig()
const title = config.name
const description = config.description
</script>
```

Let's explain the code above:

- The `<template>` section contains the HTML structure of the layout. In this example, we have a navigation bar and a main content area.
- The `<script setup>` section contains the logic of the layout. In this example, we get the configuration from the `app.config.ts` file and display the title of the blog.

## Create the index page 

Create a new folder called `content` in the root of your project. This folder will contain the articles of your blog and the index page.

Create a new file called `index.md` in the `pages` folder. This file will be the index page of your blog.

```markdown
---
id: "1"
title: "Home page"
description: "Basic home page"
date: "2024-12-31"
categories:
  - home
tags:
  - lorem
  - ipsum

layout: home
listed: false
---

```

## Run the development server

You can now start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Go to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, and you should see the home page of your blog.
  

This is cool, but, you don't have the list of all the articles. Let's add a new layout for the archives page.

## Create the layout for the archives page

Create a new file called `archive.vue` in the `layouts/themes/neo-minimalist` folder. This file will be the default layout for the archive page.


Here is an example of a basic layout file:

```vue
<template>
    <div>
        <header>
            <h1>
                {{ title }}
            </h1>
        </header>

        <main>
            <div>
                <div >
                      All Posts
                </div>

              <div >
                <section class="mt-10">
                  <MinimalistListing title="All Posts"/>
                </section>
              </div>
            </div>
        </main>
    </div>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">
const config = useAppConfig()
const title = config.name
</script>
```

This layout will display the list of all the articles. To do so, we use the `MinimalistListing` component. This component is provided by the `@bloggrify/core` package. But we will see how to create a custom component later.

Now, you can go to `http://localhost:3000/archives` in your browser, and you should see the list of all the articles.

The list is probably empty, because you don't have any articles yet. Let's add some content.

## Create the default layout for the pages

Create a new file called `default.vue` in the `layouts/themes/neo-minimalist` folder. This file will be the default layout for all pages.

Here is an example of a basic layout file:

```vue
<template>
    <div>
        <header>
            <h1>
                {{ title }}
            </h1>
        </header>

        <main>
            <div v-if="doc">
                <div >
                    <h2>
                        {{ doc.title }}
                    </h2>
                </div>

                <ContentRenderer
                    id="nuxtContent"
                    :value="doc"
                />
            </div>
        </main>
    </div>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">

defineProps<{
    doc: unknown;
}>()
const config = useAppConfig()
const title = config.name
</script>
```

The `ContentRenderer` component is a [custom component from Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/docs/components/content-renderer) that renders the content of the page.

## Add some content

You can read the [official documentation](https://bloggrify.com/introduction/getting-started) to know more about how to write articles.

But for now, you can create a new file called `hello-world.md` in the `content` folder with the following content:

```markdown
---
title: Hello World
description: A simple article to say hello to the world
---

# Hello World

This is a simple article to say hello to the world.
```

Now, you can go to `http://localhost:3000/hello-world` in your browser, and you should see the article.


And voilà, you have created a new theme from scratch! You can now start customizing it to fit your needs.
(it's probably ugly, but it's a start :) )

## Create the layout for the tag page

Create a new file called `tag.vue` in the `layouts/themes/neo-minimalist` folder. This file will be the layout for the tag page.

Here is an example of a basic layout file:

```vue
<template>
    <div>
        <header>
            <h1>
                {{ title }}
            </h1>
        </header>

        <main>
            <div>
                <div >
                      All Posts
                </div>

              <div >
                <section class="mt-10">
                  <MinimalistListing title="All Posts" :tag="tag"/>
                </section>
              </div>
            </div>
        </main>
    </div>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">
  defineProps<{
    tag: string;
  }>()
const config = useAppConfig()
const title = config.name
</script>
```

This layout will display the list of all the articles with the specified tag. To do so, we use the `MinimalistListing` component. 

Now, you can go to `http://localhost:3000/tags/lorem` in your browser, and you should see the list of all the articles with the tag "lorem".

## Create the layout for the category page

The layout for the category page is similar to the layout for the tag page. You can create a new file called `category.vue` in the `layouts/themes/neo-minimalist`. The only difference is that you have to replace the `tag` prop by the `category` prop.

## Create a custom component to display the list of articles

Let's create a custom component to display the list of articles. Create a new file called `MyOwnListing.vue` in the `components/content` folder of your project.



```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li v-for="doc in docs" :key="doc.id">
        <NuxtLink :to="`/${doc._path}`">
          {{ doc.title }}
        </NuxtLink>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <MinimalistPaginationBar :total="totalNumberOfPages"  />
  </div>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">
const props = defineProps<{
    category?: string;
    tag?: string;
}>()

const {itemsPerPage, currentPage} = usePagination()
const id = 'listing-' + props.category + '-' + props.tag 
let where = {}
if (props.category) {
    where['categories'] = { $in: [props.category] }
}
if (props.tag) {
    where['tags'] = { $in: [props.tag] }
}
where = { ...where, ...{ draft: { $ne: true }, listed: { $ne: false } } }

const numberOfPostsPerPage = itemsPerPage.value

const { data: docs } = useAsyncData(id, () => {
    return queryContent('')
        .where(where)
        .sort({ date: -1 })
        .skip((currentPage.value - 1) * numberOfPostsPerPage)
        .limit(numberOfPostsPerPage)
        .find()
})
const totalNumberOfPages = await queryContent('').where(where).count()

</script>
```

Now, you can use the `MyOwnListing` component in the `archive.vue`, `tag.vue`, and `category.vue` layouts.

You can replace the `MinimalistListing` component by the `MyOwnListing` component in the `archive.vue`, `tag.vue`, and `category.vue` layouts.

::alert
Note the use of the `usePagination` composable. This hook is provided by the `@bloggrify/core` package.
