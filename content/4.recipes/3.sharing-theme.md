# Share your theme

It is possible to share your theme with the community. Once your theme is ready to share, you can create a pull request to add your theme.

To do so, you have to follow these steps:

1. Fork the [Bloggrify repository](https://github.com/bloggrify/bloggrify.com)
2. Add your theme in the `data/templates.ts` file
3. Add an image of your theme in the `public/images/templates` folder 
4. Create a pull request

Each theme should have the following properties:
- `name`: The name of the theme
- `image`: The path to an image that represents the theme
- `author`: The author of the theme
- `demo`: The URL of a live demo of the theme

Then you can choose between two options: 
- `repository`: The URL of the repository of the theme (for public themes)
- `shop`: The URL of the shop where the theme is available (for paid themes)

Example:
```typescript
    {
        name: "Mistral",
        image: "/images/templates/bloggr.png",
        author: "eventuallycoding",
        demo: "https://mistral.bloggrify.com",
        repository: "https://github.com/bloggrify/demo-mistral",
    },
    {
        name: "Bento",
        author: "eventuallycoding",
        image: "/images/templates/bento.jpg",
        demo: "https://bento.bloggrify.com",
        shop: "https://eventuallycoding.lemonsqueezy.com/buy/449c5e3a-7b34-4bff-b2c3-957adbb6df8e",
    },
```

Once it's done, the theme will be reviewed and added to [the list of available themes](/templates).

âœ¨ Paid themes are allowed. You can add a link to a shop where the theme is available.   
Bloggrify doesn't take any commission on the sales but doesn't check the quality of the themes.
