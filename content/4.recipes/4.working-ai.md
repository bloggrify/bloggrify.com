## What is LLMs.txt?

LLMs.txt is a structured documentation format specifically designed for large language models (LLMs). Bloggrify documentation relies on nuxt content. It provides LLMs.txt files that contain comprehensive information about the framework, making it easy for AI tools to understand and assist with Bloggrify usage.

These files are optimized for AI consumption and contain structured information about concepts, usage patterns, and best practices.
