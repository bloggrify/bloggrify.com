# Create a new theme from scratch

In this recipe, we will create a new [theme](/reference/theming) from scratch. We will (re)create the theme called "Minimalist" that is included in the Bloggrify core repository.

## Getting Started

First, you need to create a new Nuxt application. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npx nuxi@latest init neo-minimalist
```

Then, you need to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install @bloggrify/core
npm install -D sass-embedded
```

Then you have to explicitly say to Nuxt that you are using Bloggrify as an extended module. You can do this by adding the following line in your `nuxt.config.js` file:

```typescript
    extends: [
        '@bloggrify/core',
    ],
```

## Create a basic configuration file

Create a new file called `app.config.ts` in the root of your project. This file will contain the configuration of your theme.   
This file will override the default configuration of Bloggrify. If you don't specify a configuration, the default configuration will be used.

Here is an example of a basic configuration file:

```typescript
export default defineAppConfig({
    url: 'https://neo-minimalist.bloggrify.com/',

    theme: 'neo-minimalist',

    name: 'Neo-minimalist Demo',
    description:
        'A minimalist theme for Bloggrify',

})
```

That's probably not enough for a complete theme, but it's a good start. You can add more configuration options later. Don't forget to read the [official documentation](https://bloggrify.com/introduction/configuration) to know more about the configuration options.

## Create the layout for the home page 

Create a new folder called `layouts/themes/neo-minimalist` in the root of your project. This folder will contain the layouts of your theme.

Create a new file called `home.vue` in the `layouts/themes/neo-minimalist` folder. This file will be the layout for the home page.


Here is an example of a basic layout file:

```vue
<template>
    <div>
        <header>
            <h1>
                {{ title }}
            </h1>
        </header>

        <main>
            <div>
                <div >
                      {{ description }}
                </div>

              <div >
                <NuxtLink to="/archives">
                  Read all posts
                </NuxtLink>
              </div>
            </div>
        </main>
    </div>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">

defineProps<{
    doc: unknown;
    docs: unknown;
    currentPage: number;
    total: number;
    category: string;
    tag: string;
}>()
const config = useAppConfig()
const title = config.name
const description = config.description
</script>
```

Let's explain the code above:

- The `<template>` section contains the HTML structure of the layout. In this example, we have a navigation bar and a main content area.
- The `<script setup>` section contains the logic of the layout. In this example, we get the configuration from the `app.config.ts` file and display the title of the blog.
- The `ContentRenderer` component is a custom component from [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/) that renders the content of the page.
- The defined props are used to pass data to the layout.

All the props are passed by the Bloggrify core package.

Bloggrify first try to find the type of the page among the following types:
- `categories`: if the url is `/categories/something/page/2`
- `tags`: if the url is `/tags/something/page/2`
- `archives`: if the url is `/archives/page/2`'
- `standard`: for all other pages

Then, it passes the following props to the layout:

- `doc`: The current document (article)
- `docs`: The list of documents (articles). Not relevant for standard pages
- `currentPage`: The current page number. Not relevant for standard pages
- `total`: The total number of pages. Not relevant for standard pages
- `category`: The current category. Not relevant for standard pages
- `tag`: The current tag. Not relevant for standard pages


## Create the index page 

Create a new folder called `content` in the root of your project. This folder will contain the articles of your blog and the index page.

Create a new file called `index.md` in the `pages` folder. This file will be the index page of your blog.

```markdown
---
id: "1"
title: "Home page"
description: "Basic home page"
date: "2024-12-31"
categories:
  - home
tags:
  - lorem
  - ipsum

layout: home
listed: false
---

```

## Run the development server

You can now start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Go to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, and you should see the home page of your blog.
  

This is cool, but, you don't have the list of all the articles. Let's add a new layout for the archives page.

## Create the layout for the archives page

Create a new file called `archive.vue` in the `layouts/themes/neo-minimalist` folder. This file will be the default layout for the archive page.


Here is an example of a basic layout file:

```vue
<template>
    <div>
        <header>
            <h1>
                {{ title }}
            </h1>
        </header>

        <main>
            <div>
                <div >
                      All Posts
                </div>

              <div >
                <section class="mt-10">
                  <div v-for="article in docs" :key="article._path">
                    <NuxtLink :to="article._path">
                      {{ article.date }} - {{ article.title }}
                    </NuxtLink>
                  </div>
                </section>
              </div>
            </div>
        </main>
    </div>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">

defineProps<{
    doc: unknown;
    docs: unknown;
    currentPage: number;
    total: number;
    category: string;
    tag: string;
}>()
const config = useAppConfig()
const title = config.name
</script>
```

This layout will display the list of all the articles. The `docs` prop contains the list of all the articles.

Now, you can go to `http://localhost:3000/archives` in your browser, and you should see the list of all the articles.

The list is probably empty, because you don't have any articles yet. Let's add some content.

## Create the layout

Create a new file called `default.vue` in the `layouts/themes/neo-minimalist` folder. This file will be the default layout for all pages.

Here is an example of a basic layout file:

```vue
<template>
    <div>
        <header>
            <h1>
                {{ title }}
            </h1>
        </header>

        <main>
            <div v-if="doc">
                <div >
                    <h2>
                        {{ doc.title }}
                    </h2>
                </div>

                <ContentRenderer
                    id="nuxtContent"
                    :value="doc"
                />
            </div>
        </main>
    </div>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">

defineProps<{
    doc: unknown;
    docs: unknown;
    currentPage: number;
    total: number;
    category: string;
    tag: string;
}>()
const config = useAppConfig()
const title = config.name
</script>
```

## Add some content

You can read the [official documentation](https://bloggrify.com/introduction/getting-started) to know more about how to write articles.

But for now, you can create a new file called `hello-world.md` in the `content` folder with the following content:

```markdown
---
title: Hello World
description: A simple article to say hello to the world
---

# Hello World

This is a simple article to say hello to the world.
```

Now, you can go to `http://localhost:3000/hello-world` in your browser, and you should see the article.


And voil√†, you have created a new theme from scratch! You can now start customizing it to fit your needs.
(it's probably ugly, but it's a start :) )
