# Change the theme

To start a new blog with Bloggrify, **you can start from a [theme](/reference/theming)** to start with.

By default, if you follow [the installation guide](/introduction/installation), you will start with the "Minimalist" theme.

You can choose to start with "Mistral" or you can also look at the [other templates available](/templates).

1. Once you have chosen a template, you have to include it in your project.

Example with the Mistral theme:

::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @bloggrify/mistral
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @bloggrify/mistral
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @bloggrify/mistral
```

::


Then you have to explicitly say to Nuxt that you are using Bloggrify as an extended module. You can do this by adding the following line in your `nuxt.config.js` file:

```json
    extends: [
        '@bloggrify/core',
        '@bloggrify/mistral',
    ],
```

2. Next, you have to specify the theme in the `app.config.ts` file:

```json
    theme: 'mistral',
```



3. Run the `dev` command to start Bloggrify in development mode:

::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm run dev
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn dev
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm run dev
```
::

::alert{type="success"}
âœ¨ Well done! A browser window should automatically open for <http://localhost:3000>

## Advanced method, start from scratch

Alternatively, you can start from scratch and create your own theme.
To do so, follow the [theme creation guide](/recipes/theme-recipe) to create your own theme.
